# Image-Classification-using-BEiT-Model
This project implements an image classification system using the BEiT model. The dataset is organized into four categories: hurricane, earthquake, wildfire, and not meaningful. The model is trained on image data, with the ability to evaluate its performance using validation and test datasets.
